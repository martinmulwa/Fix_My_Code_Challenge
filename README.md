# Fix My Code Challenge

## Background Context

`Fix My Code` is a new type of project, where weâ€™ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!

Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.

Please download the repository [0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge) and use it as initial files for all solutions.

You should not re-code everything, just fix it!
